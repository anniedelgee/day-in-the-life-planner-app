// ## psuedocode for task
// Create a variable to store the current date and time using the Moment.js library

// Display the current date and time at the top of the calendar

// Create timeblocks for standard business hours (e.g. 9am-5pm) using a for loop

// Within the for loop, create a color-coding system to distinguish between past, present, and future timeblocks

// Allow a user to enter an event by clicking on a timeblock and display the input field within that timeblock

// Create a save button within each timeblock and use an event listener to save the entered event to local storage when clicked

// Use another event listener to retrieve the saved events from local storage and display them on the calendar upon page refresh

// Ensure that the events are persisted between refreshes of a page

// Follow best practices for file structure, naming conventions, indentation, and commenting within the jQuery JavaScript file.
